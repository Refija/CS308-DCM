<h1><b> DENTAL CLINC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM </font color="red"> </h1></b>
<br> 
<h2> DESCRIPTION: </h2>
<br>
<p> As we know, many dental clinics do all their appointments and scheduling on the paper.<br> 
This can cause some issues as appointments getting mixed up or someone forgeting about the appointment completely.<br>
 Also we are living in a modern days where everything is becoming digitilized.<br>
 So our solution for this problem is Dental Clinic Managment Software. <br>
This software will serve as a tool which will make all of these problems thing of a past.<br>
 It will help doctors be more organized and eliminate the problem of mixed up appointmets,<br>
 while for the patients it will notify them before each checkup so they do not forget. <br>
Making this whole proces of going to the dentist easier and better for everyone involved.</p>
